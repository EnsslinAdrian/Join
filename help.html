                <h2>Help</h2>

                <p>Welcome to the help page for Join, your guide to using our kanban project management tool. Here,
                    we'll provide an overview of what Join is, how it can benefit you, and how to use it.</p>

                <h3>What is Join?</h3>

                <p>Join is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as
                    part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

                    Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
                    work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Join leverages the principles of kanban to help
                    users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.

                    It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended for
                    extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot
                    guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding
                    Join.</p>

                <h3>How to use it</h3>

                <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use Join:</p>

                <div class="howToUseText">
                    <h3>1.</h3>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Exploring the Board</h4>
                        <p>When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and
                            contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="howToUseText">

                    <div>
                        <h4>Creating Contacts</h4>
                        <p>In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p>
